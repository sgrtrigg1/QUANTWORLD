The motivation behind this paper was the demand for reproducing AI techniques in quantitative finance, specifically with regard to forecasting and quantitative analysis of time series data. This paper demonstrates the rationale behind applying ordinary least squares regression, sliding windows, classification, and reinforcement learning models to such datasets. Key findings include the bias variance trade-off, regime detection and predictions.
